# IDG1100-Oblig-NAVIDAMIRI
Repository for Obligatorisk Arbeidskrav in IDG1100. By Navid Amiri.


In order to answer each question, I wanted them each to be thorrow and full of information with explanations. This was done to prepare myself for the exam and have the option to go to the source and get the insight needed. This is especially taergeted question 1-8.

I have to admit, I really enjoyed working on question 11-20. 

Questions without any source are either due to the simplicity of them, or because I found the answers by watching different youtube videos combined with searching peice by peice on different forums: for example Stackoverflow - which is specially targeted question 21-23.

I am in doubt of question 24, even though I recieved notification on my email every 30 minute.

I have to thank Thomas - teaching assistant - for his thorrow explanation when I was stuck on question 25 two times. It really helped me with understanding "case" and "while loops".

Lastly, I think an oblig like this was needed to get a better insight in the ending of this course. It got me to understand the books and the powerpoints on BB better. I would saw that I feel much better prepared for the exams after this.
